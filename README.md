Solving the N-Queens Problem with Various Search Algorithms
This repository contains Python implementations for solving the classic N-Queens problem using four different algorithmic approaches: exhaustive search (Depth-First Search), Greedy Search (Hill-Climbing with random restarts), Simulated Annealing, and a Genetic Algorithm.

The project serves as a comparative study to analyze the trade-offs between these algorithms in terms of performance, efficiency, and scalability for solving this computationally difficult puzzle.

The N-Queens Problem
The N-Queens problem is a well-known puzzle in both mathematics and computer science where the objective is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem's complexity grows exponentially with the board size (N), making it an excellent benchmark for testing the performance of various search and optimization algorithms.

Algorithmic Approaches
This project implements and compares four distinct approaches to solving the N-Queens problem.

1. Exhaustive Search (Depth-First Search)
This approach uses a classic recursive backtracking implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) to systematically explore every possible placement of queens. While this method is guaranteed to find all possible solutions, its factorial time complexity (O(N!)) makes it impractical for board sizes larger than N=15.

To run the DFS implementation:

python "Exhaustive search (DFS).py"

2. Greedy Search (Hill Climbing)
This is a heuristic method that uses a standard hill-climbing approach with a random-restart mechanism. It begins with a random placement of queens and iteratively makes the move that reduces the number of conflicts the most. To avoid getting stuck in local optima, the algorithm restarts with a new random board if it cannot find a better state.

To run the Greedy Search implementation:

python "Greedy Search (Hill Climbing).py"

3. Simulated Annealing
Simulated Annealing is a more advanced heuristic inspired by the metallurgical process of annealing. It starts with a high "temperature," allowing the algorithm to make random moves, including those that increase conflicts, to explore the solution space broadly. As the temperature gradually cools, the algorithm becomes more selective, converging towards a low-conflict state. This probabilistic approach helps it escape local optima that might trap simpler greedy algorithms.

To run the Simulated Annealing implementation:

python "Simulated Annealing.py"

4. Genetic Algorithm
The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a population-based heuristic. It evolves a population of potential solutions (boards) over many generations. In each generation, solutions are selected based on their "fitness" (lower conflicts). They then "reproduce" using crossover and mutation operations to create a new generation of solutions. This method proved to be the most effective at finding conflict-free solutions for large N in this study.

To run the Genetic Algorithm implementation:

python "Genetic Algorithm.py"

Methodology
All algorithms were implemented in Python 3 and designed to use a common state representation for the chessboard: a 1D list of N integers, where the list index represents the row and the value at that index represents the column of a queen. This efficient representation inherently prevents two queens from being in the same row, reducing the search space.

The heuristic algorithms used the following parameters:

Greedy Search: Implemented with a maximum of 200 random restarts.

Simulated Annealing: Used an initial temperature of 100 and a cooling rate of 0.995.

Genetic Algorithm: A population of 100 individuals was run for 1000 generations with a mutation rate of 10%.

Summary of Results
The comparative analysis revealed a clear trade-off between the guaranteed correctness of an exhaustive search and the efficiency of heuristic methods.

Depth-First Search (DFS): Guaranteed to find a solution but becomes practically unusable for board sizes larger than N=15 due to its exponential runtime.

Greedy Search: The fastest of the heuristic methods in terms of raw speed, but it was also the least effective, often getting stuck in local optima and failing to find a perfect solution for larger boards.

Simulated Annealing: Performed better than Greedy Search due to its ability to escape local optima. However, it still began to fail on very large board sizes, ending with several conflicts.

Genetic Algorithm: Proved to be the most successful heuristic overall, providing the best balance of speed, scalability, and accuracy. It consistently found conflict-free or near-conflict-free solutions for large-scale instances of the problem (up to N=200).

Memory consumption for all algorithms was low and stable, confirming that the primary challenge of the N-Queens problem is time complexity, not space complexity.

Conclusion
For small problems (N < 15) where time is not a concern, DFS is the best choice as it guarantees a correct solution. For larger, more real-world scale challenges, heuristic approaches are the only viable option. Among the tested heuristics, the Genetic Algorithm demonstrated the most robust performance, making it the most suitable choice for finding high-quality solutions to large-scale N-Queens problems in a reasonable amount of time.
